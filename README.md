Quota Android App

NOTE: If master branch seems incomplete, go to the Noah branch. Attempted to make the branch the master branch, but unsure if overwrote the master correctly. The Noah branch has the most updated version.

Quota - a practical to-do list app for iOS and Android. (HoyaHacks 2016 Project) See accompanying iOSapp: https://github.com/matthewmuccio/QuotaiOS

Quota is a typical to-do list app for rather forgetful people; the user creates an account (with email and password), which connects to Firebase. Then the user can add tasks to their list and remove them as he or she completes them.

INCOMPLETE FEATURES:

Firebase integration: The tasks are not saved or loaded to or from the Firebase database right now.

HoyaHacks was our very first hackathon, so we really did not know what to expect. Although our app was not fully completed, we really enjoyed the experience. Thanks HoyaHacks!
